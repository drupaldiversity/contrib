## Check-In

How are people feeling about the contrib team overall? 

* Still excited but discouraged by slow progress
* Wondering how much mentors should be prodding mentees
* Perhaps the front-end should try a smaller project

## Global Sprint Weekend (26-28 January 2017) https://groups.drupal.org/node/517797

* We will not be participating as a group due to low interest/availability. 

## DDI Contrib Team at Nashville

* What do we want to do at Nashville?
  * Last time we discussed proposing a session, but it seems we don't have the momentum for it. 
  * Mentoring at sprints. How do we make sure we are fulfilling our goal of helping under-represented individuals in particular? 
  * What about going to the first-time attendee social and recruiting?
