  * agentrickard
  * sparklingrobots (likely)
  * angelam (likely)
  * mdrummond

* What do we want to do at Nashville?
  * Submit a session about our work (about helping a wider range of people to contribute and by contributing, showing to the wider Drupal community just one of the benefits of focusing on D&I work for the community.)

## Global Sprint Weekend (26-28 January 2017) https://groups.drupal.org/node/517797

* We could do one of two things: 
  1. Try to get new people involved in the effort. That tends to mean helping people get locals set up and working on the basics of using the issue queue. 
  2. Dedicate time ourselves to being online and collaborating with each other in a focused way.
* General consensus was that it would be more productive to pursue using the time as a group. 
* TODO: Tori & agentrickard/sparklingrobots to plan sprints with each team. 

## Year-End Review
* sparklingrobots wants to spend more time finding new mentees & building our long-term vision.
* We want to keep going with our existing cohorts as it feels like we are still ramping up. 
* laurarocks suggests we may need more structure.
* Team C submitted a patch!! https://www.drupal.org/project/examples/issues/2897630
* mdrummond writes: I was also thinking back to how we initially resisted working with outside organizations that help with mentoring new contributors. I’m now wondering if there might be some value in that. It’s not easy setting up a mentoring process, and it would be helpful if we could guide people towards a mentoring org to help get everyone on the same page. Maybe still provide supportive check-ins for those working on that? And then once folks are feeling like yes, I know how to contribute, then getting them to work in small groups on specific contribution tasks that they can work on together towards some larger goals.
* We need to get clear about the value we add to the existing mentorship ecosystem & how we want to collaborate or not. 
* TODO: Create a 'how-to' guide for leaving comments on drupal.org. laurarocks writes: "And by the way, it just occurred to me that during Vienna sprint day, it was really helpful when somebody directed/mentored me how I should put my words in the reply to the issue queue. It’s really more intimidating that I thought."  We could also have some suggestions for how we present ourselves in the issue queues as well. https://github.com/drupaldiversity/contrib/issues/47
