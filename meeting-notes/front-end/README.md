# Front-End Contrib Team

This document attempts to outline the current and next steps for the front-end contrib team.

## Get Involved

You can get involved during our weekly meetings via Drupal Slack. We have a discussion through various threads in the #ddi-contrib-team channel and work toward our collective goals during this check-in.

### Drupal Slack

Joining the Slack team is simple (and free)! Navigate to https://www.drupal.org/slack and follow the steps to get access. There are multiple teams ("Groups") on the page. The one you will want to join is "Drupal (drupal)"

### Meetings

You can always find our meeting times via Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=acreative.io_0917r07ben68pqct80uj9qoah0%40group.calendar.google.com. Look for "Front-End Meeting" to see if the times have updated, but generally we meet at 11am Pacific Standard Time on Thursdays.

You can see the common offsets or gauge where your timezone fits into our meetings times here: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2018&month=1&day=11&hour=19&min=0&sec=0&p1=137&p2=136&p3=47&p4=195.

## Team Resources

We primarily use Github to track issues/tasks for the team. You can see these issues (and file more) at: 

### Open Tasks

You can find the open tasks by navigating to the contrib repo and going to issues. Sorting by the "Drupal Front-End Team" Project is the easiest way to narrow down to ours.

### Meeting Notes & Agendas

Each week the meeting notes are posted in Github as an issue. They are generally left open until the next weekly meeting (then closed when the new agenda/notes are posted). Here is a Github URL with the correct project and filters applied: https://github.com/drupaldiversity/contrib/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+project%3Adrupaldiversity%2Fcontrib%2F2+label%3Ameeting+

The meeting notes are also aggregated via Google Docs: https://goo.gl/8ZpB3h
