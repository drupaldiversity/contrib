Top Level Ideas 

*We are building a Blog Theme

*The theme is aimed at people using Site-building tools to make their blog

*We plan on using @sparklingrobots & @mdrummond, and perhaps 2-3 other Drupal bloggers they know as  stakeholders/use cases to work with/from

*The Theme should be able to stand on its own on a design level.

*Theme should respond well to subthemeing, tho.

*The Theme should Leverage Css Grid and Pattern Lab if possible

*The Theme Should make the process of setting up a blog as frictionless as possible.


Next Design steps?

* Get the stakeholders together to ask them some Creative Brief questions on what they want from and Ideal Blog Theme? What sort of feel they want it to have? I’m talking “how do you want people to feel about the blog, what mood should it communicate? Who do you imagine in reading your blog and what information do you want them to take away from how it looks?” etc etc. kind of questions.
