## Should we look for other testing issues outside of the phpunit initiative

* See the analysis at https://github.com/drupaldiversity/contrib/issues/10 done by zenlan.
* Should we consider looking at other work for this team given that most of the remaining work is tagged as “hard” or “very hard”?
  * What tests do we want to focus on? Contrib? D9 blockers? Issue triage? Writing testts for novice issues?
  1 Learn to use the queue
  1 Help enforce bug reporting standards
  1 Write tests that show bugs
  1 Fix bugs
* Do we want to stay focused on testing work?
  * Yes.
* See https://www.drupal.org/node/2608062 for background.


## mdrummond's proposed workflow

*  identify issues to work with,
* set up a group of 2-3 people to work on each issue together: Someone who understands tests can help guide somebody else as to how to approach the issue, what things to look at without writing the code themselves. The mentee actually writes the patch. Then at least one other person tests the issue to see if it works and posts that on issue. If that person feels comfortable they can also do code review on the issue or the mentor can do that. Then all work together to get issue to RTBC.

* Idea approved.
* How to split into teams?
